# invader.nvim
Invader is a typelib helper for neovim. Typelibs is what is used to load
gobject based libraries into dynamic languages (glib, gio, gtk, etc). This is
very cool but comes with a problem, neovim and the lsp can't pickup the
bindings, documentation, etc. This makes the neovim experience sub-optimal.

This plugin uses [gir-to-stub](https://github.com/dagle/gir-to-stub) to
generate a stub file (by default). What invader.nvim does is that it creates an
automated interface to use with
[neoconf.nvim](https://github.com/folke/neoconf.nvim). Right now it only
supports lua but hopefully this will change in the future.

## ‚ö°Ô∏èInstall 
First you need to install [gir-to-stub](https://github.com/dagle/gir-to-stub).
Alternativly you need a way to obtain the stub-files. 

### [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
``` lua
  { 'dagle/invader.nvim',
    dependencies = 'folke/neoconf.nvim',
  },
```

## üöÄ Usage

```lua
require("neoconf").setup({
  -- override any of the default settings here
})
-- Add invader after neoconf but before the lsp starts
require("invader").setup({})

-- setup your lsp servers as usual
require("lspconfig").sumneko_lua.setup(...)
```

To setup your .neoconf.json, look in the neoconf.json.example
